## Key Concept
We will examine satellite maps showing the distribution of maternal dens of polar bears in Alaska and the movement tracks of adult polar bears to see if the activity areas of polar bears are affected by population growth, human activities, environmental pollution, or climate change in the regions of Alaska.

## Our Hypothesis
We believe that there will be a link between polar bears migrating away from zip codes with higher population density, higher restaurant/factory density, and higher air temperatures in Alaska.

## Alaska's Annual Population



## Maternal Dens of Polar Bears
This map shows the different locations of polar bear dens in Alaska. We can see that all of the dens are scattered around the northern coastal areas of Alaska and beyond. It is important to note their location and compare it to Alaska’s human population. If you interact with the different layers, you will be able to tell that as the years go on from 2010, there is less and less activity within the dens. So in 2010, there were more recorded polar bear dens, indicating a healthier population and habitat. However, by 2018, the number of dens had decreased, emphasizing the impact of human activities such as climate change, habitat disruption, and pollution on the polar bear population in Alaska. These factors affect polar bears living conditions, making them stay further north, and away from the majority of Alaska’s human population. 


## Human Construction and Activity

## Impact of Chemical Pollution on Polar Bears

## Effects of Climate Change on Polar Bears

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our research highlights the significant impact of human activity in Alaska on polar bears. While looking at factors such as changing temperatures, population, pollution, and an overall rise in human activity in Alaska, we can conclude that these factors have affected polar bear activity, as shown in the graphs and maps above. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for conservation efforts and policy measures aimed at mitigating these impacts. Protecting polar bear habitat, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, implementing responsible practices in Arctic industries, and minimizing pollution are crucial steps to help ensure the long-term survival of these polar bears. By taking action to address these human-induced challenges, we can work towards a more sustainable coexistence between humans and polar bears in Alaska, as this website that we made serves as a medium to promote environmental protection.
